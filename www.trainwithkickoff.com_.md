What our clients have to say about Kickoff
Get Matched

Actually motivates you

It's awesome to have somebody that takes what you have to say and provides feedback in a way that doesn't make you feel bad about yourself but actually motivates you!

Jerett P.
Google Play Store

Way more accountability than an app

My trainer held me accountable, pushed me to get my workouts in, and stick to nutrition goals, things that other fitness apps lack.

Lauren G.
Apple App Store

Working with a human is a game changer

I love working with a HUMAN instead of some app notification...It's a game changer for me and I never regret it.

The best way to train

This is the best way to train if you have goals you want to reach and don‚Äôt have the ability to shell out $$$$ every month for an in-person trainer.

Things would always come up. Kickoff changed that.

I was tired of feeling like I just couldn't get to the gym, eat right, or get to my goals. Things would always come up... Kickoff has changed that.

My personal trainer is there whenever I need him or have questions. The daily checkins keep me accountable and am loving the results!

Makes fitness simple

Kickoff makes fitness so simple. I have always been willing to put the time and effort in but struggled with staying consistent. The support from a qualified coach made all the difference.
